# Prototype Pattern

## Intent
Specifies the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and creates new objects by copying this prototype.

## Explanation
The Prototype pattern is a creational design pattern that lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes. It allows you to produce new objects by copying existing ones, which serve as prototypes.

## When to use
* When the types of objects to create are determined by prototypical instances
* When you need to avoid building a class hierarchy of factories that parallels the class hierarchy of products
* When instances of a class can have only a few different combinations of state

## Structure
```
+------------------+                   +------------------+
|    Prototype     |<------------------|  ClientCode     |
+------------------+                   +------------------+
| + clone()        |                   | + operation()    |
+------------------+                   +------------------+
       ^
       |
+------------------+
| ConcretePrototype|
+------------------+
| + clone()        |
+------------------+
```

## Real-world examples
* Document copying in a word processor
* Cloning complex objects in a game
* Creating variations of objects without manual configuration

## Implementation details
* Define a prototype interface that declares a cloning method
* Implement the clone method in the prototype class
* Handle deep copy vs shallow copy as appropriate
* Manage complex object structures and circular references

## TypeScript implementation notes
In TypeScript, we implement the Prototype pattern by:
1. Creating an interface with a clone method
2. Implementing the interface in concrete classes
3. Using generics to ensure type safety in the cloning process
4. Handling deep copying and circular references carefully

## Pros and Cons

### Pros
* You can clone objects without coupling to their concrete classes
* You can avoid repeated initialization code by cloning pre-built prototypes
* You can produce complex objects more conveniently
* You get an alternative to inheritance when dealing with configuration presets

### Cons
* Cloning complex objects with circular references can be tricky
* Deep copying can be resource-intensive for complex objects
* May require careful implementation to ensure proper deep copying
