# TypeScript Design Patterns (Gang of Four)

Welcome to the documentation for the TypeScript Gang of Four Design Patterns implementation. This project provides practical implementations of all 23 classic design patterns described in the famous book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides (the "Gang of Four").

## What are Design Patterns?

Design patterns are typical solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They represent best practices evolved over time by experienced software developers.

Each pattern is like a blueprint that can be customized to solve a particular design problem in your code. They are not finished designs that can be directly transformed into code, but rather templates for how to solve problems in various situations.

## Pattern Categories

The Gang of Four design patterns are categorized into three groups:

### üèóÔ∏è Creational Patterns

These patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code:

- **Factory Method**: Creates objects without specifying the exact class to create
- **Abstract Factory**: Creates families of related objects
- **Builder**: Separates construction from representation
- **Prototype**: Creates objects by cloning existing objects
- **Singleton**: Ensures a class has only one instance

### üß± Structural Patterns

These patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient:

- **Adapter**: Allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate
- **Bridge**: Separates an abstraction from its implementation
- **Composite**: Composes objects into tree structures
- **Decorator**: Adds responsibilities to objects dynamically
- **Facade**: Provides a simplified interface to a set of interfaces
- **Flyweight**: Minimizes memory usage by sharing data with similar objects
- **Proxy**: Provides a surrogate for another object

### üîÑ Behavioral Patterns

These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects:

- **Chain of Responsibility**: Passes a request along a chain of handlers
- **Command**: Turns a request into a stand-alone object
- **Interpreter**: Implements a specialized language
- **Iterator**: Accesses elements of a collection sequentially
- **Mediator**: Reduces coupling between classes by centralizing communication
- **Memento**: Captures and restores an object's internal state
- **Observer**: Notifies dependent objects about state changes
- **State**: Alters an object's behavior when its state changes
- **Strategy**: Encapsulates interchangeable algorithms
- **Template Method**: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm
- **Visitor**: Separates algorithms from the objects they operate on

## Using This Documentation

Each pattern documentation includes:

1. **Overview**: A brief explanation of the pattern's purpose and use cases
2. **TypeScript Implementation**: Code examples showing how to implement the pattern in TypeScript
3. **Example Usage**: Practical examples of how to use the pattern in real-world scenarios
4. **Considerations**: Important notes, variations, and trade-offs
