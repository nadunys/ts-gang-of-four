# Chain Of Responsibility Pattern

> This pattern documentation is coming soon.

## Intent
Avoids coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one object a chance to handle the request. Chains the receiving objects and passes the request along the chain until an object handles it.

## Structure
*Documentation in progress*
